Produced by MLB Network, the game's play-by-play announcers and analysts include Harold Reynolds, Rich Waltz, Colby Lewis and Elise Woodward.

The game can be accessed in the United States on the MLB Live show Page and is accessible on Facebook Watch across all supported devices including mobile phones and connected televisions.

In addition to each live game broadcast MLB is also producing and distributing specially curated content including on-demand highlight packages for every regular season game as well as Club-specific weekly recap packages for all 30 MLB teams. These will be available on Facebook Watch in the United States and via Club show Pages globally.

The Facebook partnership is the result of MLB's efforts to better position baseball for the future by experimenting beyond traditional television and look to new platforms for distribution and to connect fans to the game through technology. MLB is now in the second year of its partnership with Twitter to stream one game a week. Twitter games are not exclusive to the platform and are only available outside the teams' home markets.
