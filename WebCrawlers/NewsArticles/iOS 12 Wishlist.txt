With WWDC imminent, here are my top wishes this year.

I want to be wowed!

I mostly use my iPhone in the dark and even with the lowest brightness setting, it’s still too bright. Dark mode should also result in better battery life on iPhone X because of its OLED screen.

I’m sure I’m not the only one fed up with the volume indicator obscuring the video you’re watching. The centered volume HUD works on macOS as it only takes up a tiny part of the screen. Bringing it to iOS was a huge mistake. Time to fix that.

Siri is a joke compared to what Google is doing and the Photos app is way behind Google Photos on smartness.

Notifications have just gotten worse with each recent iOS release.

The ability to change default apps or some kind of intent system. We all know Google Maps is better. And I prefer Google Inbox over Mail.

One of the main selling points of the iPhone is the camera. Compressed photos are not enough! Some of us want the highest quality possible.

We’ve had the static grid of app icons for 10 years now. It’s been great, but it’s time for something new and more dynamic. I imagine something mixing widgets and apps.

The Photos app is actually pretty good, but it still leaves a lot to be desired. The face detection is so-so. The photos chosen for the Memories feature feel arbitrary. Many useful adjustments are missing, like white balance, noise reduction, and vignette. I wish you could copy-paste adjustments from one photo to another. iCloud Photo Library is slow to sync and it’s slow to download cloud-only photos. My iPhone often saves videos with the incorrect orientation, so I wish you could rotate videos too.

What’s your wishlist? Let me know on Twitter.
