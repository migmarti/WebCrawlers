The first Intel CPU using a 10nm manufacturing process has been confirmed as the Core i3-8121U - a 2-core/4-thread Cannon Lake mobile processor that looks set to find its way into Lenovo laptops sometime soon according to German website Computer Base.

Interestingly, there doesn't appear to be evidence that the CPU includes an integrated graphics processor - something that's listed in detail on the product page of the Coffee Lake-based Core i3-8109U. This could simply be down to the fact that Intel does not wish to reveal details of the onboard graphics of Cannon Lake CPUs at this time, or it's decided to cut the feature out of certain product ranges in favor of using separate graphics cards.

Intel itself has confirmed the news on its website, where a product page for the CPU now exists. Being a mobile part, the CPU will be limited to laptops and there's still no sign of desktop 10mn parts, with so-called 'Cannon Lake' CPUs having been delayed numerous time, most recently last month when we learned we'd likely have to wait till 2019.

Intel's tick-tock cycle was abandoned a couple of years ago in favor of additional cycles of optimization on each manufacturing process, most likely due to issues shrinking things further to 10nm and subsequent Cannon Lake delays. The result is that since its current 14nm lithography was introduced back in 2015 with the Broadwell architecture, we've seen three more generations of 14nm CPUs - Skylake, Kaby Lake and most recently Coffee Lake, with the promise of yet another range of CPUs this year that will likely include its most powerful mainstream desktop CPU ever - an 8-core beast, as it tries to reign in AMD's Ryzen 7 range of CPUs.

However, the fact that there is now concrete proof of Cannon Lake's arrival means that it might finally be getting a handle on its next manufacturing process node, which is now well-overdue and most certainly needed to combat AMD, which is stealing market share following it's launch of Ryzen in 2017 and 2nd Generation Ryzen a year later last month.
