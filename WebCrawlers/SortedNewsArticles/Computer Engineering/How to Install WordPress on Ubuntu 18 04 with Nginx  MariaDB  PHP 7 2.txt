Lets start with the requirements. You dont need much.

Before we go on, these instructions are for people that plan on installing and managing a WordPress server themselves. If you dont know how to manage a server, get managed WordPress hosting and skip this tutorial.

And search for this line:

Uncomment the line by removing the ; and update it to 0:

Find all the following lines in the php.ini file and update them accordingly:

You can use different values depending on your server.

First, log in to your MariaDB server with the password you set earlier:

And create a database for your WordPress by running these commands:

With these commands, youll create a database and a user and grant permissions to the user. You can use your own names instead of these. Remember to use a strong password.

Start by navigating to the directory where you want to download WordPress. Well use Nginxs default directory:

Extract the archive in the directory youre currently in:

And paste the following (after updating example.com to your domain)

Run the following command to test and see if everythings ok with Nginx:

Then install a certificate for your domain:

At the prompts, agree to the Terms and Conditions by entering a and then optionally subscribe to ETF with y.

IMPORTANT: the certbot will ask you whether to redirect all traffic to HTTPS (option 2) or not (option 1), you need to choose option 2. So enter 2.

The certbot will automatically update your Nginx configuration file. A Lets Encrypt certificate lasts 90 days by default. Youll be notified before it expires, so you can renew it.

To automatically update your certificate, set up a cron job by running:

Some frequently asked questions (with answers!) and common issues related to installing WordPress on Ubuntu:

No, but its definitely recommended since its free and easy to set up anyway. If you dont plan on using an SSL certificate you can just skip step 10.

It can be caused by many things, but its most probably an error in your wp-config.php file. Make sure youre using the right information (user, password etc.)

We used Nginx so theres no .htaccess file. This can be confusing for a beginner since many tutorials include instructions for Apache by default. The .htaccess of Nginx is the /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com file you created earlier. Note that you cannot use the same .htaccess code in your Nginx configuration file.

Better not. You already installed everything manually. You dont really need it anyway. If you do plan on using a control panel then its better if you start fresh and dont follow this tutorial at all.

It offers you more control over everything. You decide what you use and how you use it. Theres always an option to just get WordPress cloud hosting without having to install or do anything yourself, but wheres the fun in that? 

Sure you can! And the process is way easier  youll install everything in this tutorial (and more) with a single command if you use a tool like EasyEngine or Centmin Mod.
