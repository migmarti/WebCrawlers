EA Sports ran a simulator of their FIFA 18 game in the recently announced World Cup mode to predict which country will likely win the upcoming 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. According to the FIFA 18 World Cup mode simulation, France will emerge World Cup winners after beating Germany 4-3 on penalties in the final of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Earlier in May 2018 EA Sports announced its new World Cup 2018 update which has been free to download for existing FIFA 18 game players from 29 May 2018.

"Unsurprisingly, the final was predicted to be a tight one; the ruthless German machine was halted by France over 120 minutes. Each side only managed to notch a single goal, sending it all the way to a penalty shootout. The talented penalty takers and experienced goalkeepers on both sides kept the contest as tight as it had been since the first whistle, but it was Les Bleus who came out on top with a 4-3 shootout result," said EA Sports in a statement.

EA Sports explained that it used their FIFA 18 game as well as the new country ratings from the 2018 FIFA World Cup update. They then ran a simulation of the tournament from the group stage all the way through to the final in Moscow.

What is interesting is that, according to the simulation, no Afrikan country makes it out of the group stages. Even Mohammed Salah's Egypt is predicted to finish third in their group behind Russia in second and Uruguay in first position.

Interestingly, the simulation predicts France's Antoine Griezmann will be the star of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

"Frances Antoine Griezmann and Spains Isco were in a very tight race for much of the tournament, and neither came out on top as they tied to share the Golden Boot with five goals apiece. Its no surprise since he won the Golden Boot and picked up a winners medal, but Antoine Griezmann was also named the best player of the tournament after consistently putting on a scintillating show with France."
