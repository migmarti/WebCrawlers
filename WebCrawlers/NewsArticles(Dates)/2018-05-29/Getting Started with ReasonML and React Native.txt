Here is a guide on how to get started with React Native and ReasonML. For the purpose of this blog post I assume that you are already familiar with React Native and partially with ReasonML. If you are not set with ReasonML yet, check out the docs.

Now we can initialise a new React Native project, just like we would do with every React Native app:

We will need 3 packages:

Let’s add them to our project:

Now we need to create a , which is a BuckleScript’s configuration file:

Let’s stop for a minute in here. There are a few bits that are different from the usual setup.

First is , makes BuckleScript aware that it should check subdirectories for code that should be compiled.

The other one is , this one is pretty handy, generates output alongside source files (by default they are output to ). This is pretty useful when we reference  files or assets files. Without it, to import an image you will reference it like:

with the option , it’s going to look like:

I prefer the latter, hence I enable the option.

Let’s also add a few scripts to the that we will use later to compile our code:

We are done with the configuration, to recap, we added three packages: , and . Then we added BuckleScript’s config file , that’s all! 🎉

As we previously defined in the we will keep all of our ReasonML code in the directory. In the newly created directory (in the root of our project), let’s add , it could look something like:

I also removed the from the root of the project (that’s the file that is generated by React Native CLI).

Last thing we need to do is import our compiled into the :

Finally we can compile our code by running:

This will watch for any changes you do to your Reason code and compile (if there are no errors).

You should see:
