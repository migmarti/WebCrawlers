Many entrepreneurs looking for Blockchain startup ideas which can provide them more rewards and felicitous to their expertise in order to exploit through technology.

Let me remind ,blockchain technology was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto in order to develop world’s first digital and secured currency which is an advanced version of Hashing algorithm SHA-256.Bitcoin resource is open to everyone which helps to develop on this technology or develop Dapps , another successor of this platform is Ethereum ,which is highly efficient and works on smart contracts ,over 1499 Dapps or decentralized apps have been developed under ethereum networks which provides them scalability and reliability.

Blockchain technology gives us the power of decentralization by neglecting government interference in performing of network.Blockchain technology helps entrepreneur to collect funds through ICO’s and major crowdfunding sources with the help of internet.This kind of smart economy enables people to claim more rewards for their work which is not possible in centralization. Centralized systems are vulnerable to fraud, hacking, abuse of trust while Decentralized system is opened and secure to all.

Many people know the use of Blockchain technology by Retail Giant Walmart by using Blockchain track some products back to their roots.They use to track products by scanning them and getting information about product such as from where did it produced and where did it transformed which is very useful for Walmart in security and other factors.

It makes the process of transportation very transparent which is developed some tests tracking its cargo.Use of blockchain technology’s cryptographic signatures makes it harder for anyone to mislay goods and misuse of labels and reduces the time in transiting goods.

Choose best network for developing your platform ,two best platforms for Dapps are Ethereum and Bitcoin networks.Whats the difference between them ,Bitcoin is the oldest and starter of cryptocurrency and Ethereum is the hybrid version which has a lightning network.Transaction processing capacity by the chain of the Bitcoin network is limited by the average block creation time of 10 minutes,maximum 3.3 and 7 transactions per second is processed by bitcoin network.

Ethereum is the best blockchain network and Because of a hard-coded limit on computation per block,this network can process 10-30 transactions per second,which is developed by a prodigy named Vitalik Buterin but it may not possible it Bitcoin won’t be invented.

SO, have you decided to launch your own cryptocurrency and collect funds or using this technology to develop apps then remember “With great power ,comes great responsibility”
